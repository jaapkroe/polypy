Rev. B 44, 4925]\r\n- Generate xyz files with atoms marked for visualization of rings\r\n- Detect subgraphs; defect clusters; atom chains; neighbor shells\r\n- Progress bars!\r\n\r\n## Obtain code\r\n\r\nThe only file required is \"polypy\", simply download it or clone this repository.\r\n\r\n## Example use\r\n    polypy file.xyz                                 *use default settings*\r\n    polypy -s -d0 --pbc \"15.0 21.0 12.0\" file.xyz   *simplified info file, (d0) inifinite depth search, and periodic boundary conditions*\r\n    polypy -h                                       *print standard help*\r\n    \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
